        <p>
          Hi, I'm Jose. I'm originally from Venezuela. I moved to the U.S.A five years ago.
          I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. I'm currently doing a Software Development 
          Boot Camp in the University of Denver. I love spending time with my wife watching movies, and doing outdoor activities.
